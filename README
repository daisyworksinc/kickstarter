This is my KickStarter project -- (nothing to do with kickstarter.com).  I call it KickStarter b/c it provides some base infrastructure for quickly building out a new WebApp.  I intend to make many different branches of it for various pieces of functionality I want, and then
I can just switch to a branch, clone it, and begin developing on it w/o the hassle of setting up all the project nonsense.

Feel free to use it for whatever you wish.  No license.

The first such project is...

-----------
The Modern Browser File Upload
-----------
The user can drag-n-drop a file off the desktop into the browser and send the file and XML metadata about the file as a POST to a simple CXF REST-based service.  You can also calculate the MD5 client side, and validate it server-side.

I'm making use of the newer File APIs like:

Enjoy.
